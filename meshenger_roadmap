-find a way to prioritize the index/message download threads. Perhaps these threads could tell other threads to pause?
	the discover -> age check -> index -> messages -> timestamp script should not be interrupted when one of the steps takes longer

-file deletion or time to live (client side?)

-prevent WebSheet (ios) and etc captive portal to hijack the client connection ;)

-perhaps replace the functionality of self.devices with something based on crawling nodes/hash/

- HTTP calls the client needs:
- /msg/<uid> -> give list of all messages for this uid
- /msg/<uid>/<timestamp>.json -> get message for this timestamp
- /clients -> return list of all known clients (uid's + usernames)
- /getUID -> return uid for client ( based on what? mac? )
