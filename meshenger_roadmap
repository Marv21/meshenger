-find a way to prioritize the index/message download threads. Perhaps these threads could tell other threads to pause?

SOLVED -nodes that are new to the network don't immediately download indices from the other nodes

-nodes that disconnect from the network should be removed from lists of known devices

-file deletion or time to live (client side?)

-prevent WebSheet (ios) and etc captive portal to hijack the client connection ;)
